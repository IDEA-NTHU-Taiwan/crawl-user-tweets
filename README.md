This is a python utility function that can be used to extract tweets from a user's profile.

In order for the script to work you need to do the following:

1. Make sure you have all the libraries istalled before running the script
2. You need to obtain your own keys to access the API
3. Due to the restriction on the Twitter Public API, the script pauses for a couple minutes and retrieves user tweets by bulk until the limit is reached.

NOTE: I am not to sure how many tweets it recieves every round but you can play around with the script to figure it out.

Feel free to contribute to the script as it can be very useful for other different type of projects besides just crawling user's tweets. This is just a basic script doing basic crawling.
